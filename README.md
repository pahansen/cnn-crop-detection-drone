University research project 2020 for CNN development

High level documentation of the development of a Convolutional-Neural-Network (CNN) including automatic labeling of training data to detect plants on agricultural fields. Research goal was to see if crops can be distinguished from weeds by a CNN using aerial images. By knowing the locations with high weed pressure, the use of pesticides could be reduced because they only need to be applied where they are actually required. Images were shot with a DJI Phantom in heights of 5m, 10m and 15m.

## Preparation of training data
Based on the aerial images, training for the CNN can be created.

However, looking at this example image it is clear that labeling every plant by hand is not feasible because hundreds of these image snippets are necessary to cover an entire agricultural field. Therefore, an automatic labeling approach was developed.

First, plants are segmented from the background into masks by leveraging index based segmentation with excessive green index + otsu thresholding. Based on the plant mask, a hough lines transformation is computed to identify crop rows. By assuming that only crop grows on crop rows and weed grows next to crop rows, all plants that intersect the hough lines can be labeled as crop.

Image shows computed hough lines. Based on these lines, intersecting plant contours are cut from the image to generate training data.
